      I built this app to make getting the goods available at any supplier
      must faster, using the rules from Merchant Princes. Some of the tables
      in Traveller are fun to roll on, but the nested tables needed to find out
      what you could buy isn't much fun after the first time, and it can be hard to
      be certain you actually rolled everything correctly, and rerolling additional
      goods from a table you already rolled on because it came up again isn't nearly
      as fun as negotiating the price and getting paid.

      The Exotics are the only section that I wasn't able to perfectly handle,
      because they work differently than all the rest of the goods. It will generate
      the kind of Exotic good, but it won't roll the exact number of items, so you
      will still need to reference the book for those if they come up. Each ton listed
      means one roll on the table, in the rare case that multiple exotic goods show up.
      According to the book they don't actually take up any tonnage.
